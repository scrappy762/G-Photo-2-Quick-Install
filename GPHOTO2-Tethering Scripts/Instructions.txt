gphoto2 (obviously)
geeqie (photo viewer)
entangle (camera interface system)
bitwarden (password manager)
Angry IP Scanner (easy gui based network scanner)
Team Viewer (Remote Desktop Client)
Insync (to sync to google or one drive)

Install Steps: 
1.) Extract gPHOTO2-Tethering Scripts to /home folder
2.) CD GPHOTO2-Tethering-Scripts

4.) sudo ./installer
5.) Configure the apps on each user.
